# sql-challenge

In this challenge I Engineered and Analyzed an employee database using PostgreSQL and QuickDBD. Starting by carefully reviewing the CSV files and then creating the tables in PostgreSQL as shown in the "tables.sql" file, and inserting the CSV files into these tables. After this I reviewed each table under the schema tab to ensure correct results. I then created queries to refine this data as showin int he "queries.sql" file. Finally utilizing QuickDBD I created an ERD (entity relationship diagram) as shown in the screenshot "ERD" PNG file.
